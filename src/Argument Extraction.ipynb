From The Rudd Center, now at U. Conn: A press release announces publication of its new study in Childhood Obesity demonstrating that the rules have led to an increase in fruit consumption without increasing plate waste.\\n\\nUSDA, understandably pleased with this result, quotes Secretary Tom Vilsack in a press release:\\n\\nFor Congress to meddle with doctors’ recommendations and go back to less healthy meals now would not be in the best interest of our children.\\n\\n2. From the Harvard School of Public Health: It also sends a press release to announce its study demonstrating that an increase in consumption of fruits and vegetables is a direct result of the new USDA standards, and that these also do not increase plate waste.\\n\\n3. From the Union of Concerned Scientists: UCS announces a new position paper, “Lessons from the Lunchroom: Childhood Obesity, School Lunch, and the Way to a Healthier Future,” also documenting why school meals are so important to kids’ health. This report comes with an explanatory Infographic.\\n\\nAll of these aim to head off congressional opposition to the new standards and keep them in place.\\n\\nLet’s hope this science-based strategy does some good.\\n\\nPostscript: Dana Woldow argues that the school food scene would be much easier if schools actually got enough money to pay for what they serve and for decent wages to school food service workers.</td>\n",

There are 34 million ways to customize it, depending on toppings and crust and size, according to the number-crunchers at Domino’s.\\n\\nThat’s the message that some of the nation’s largest pizza chains want to impress upon Capitol Hill lawmakers Wednesday as they push for changes to a proposed menu labeling plan that would force chain restaurants and other food outlets to post the calorie counts of the foods they’re selling.\\n\\nA fledgling coalition of pizza chains — including Domino’s, Papa John’s, Little Caesars, Godfather’s Pizza and Pizza Hut — argues that the government’s plan forces store owners to pay for in-store menu boards that most of their customers don’t see before ordering. The American Pizza Community, as the coalition is called, says 90 percent of their orders are placed online and over the phone.\\n\\nThen there’s the problem of squeezing all the potential offerings onto one menu board.\\n\\n“A light bulb goes on when people hear about all the possible combinations for pizza,” said Lynn Liddle, a Domino’s executive and chair of the coalition. “They start to realize how difficult it would be to take a one-size-fits-all approach.”\\n\\nCongress required menu labeling as part of the health-care reform law enacted in 2010, and the FDA has been working on the details ever since. The goal is to combat obesity by helping consumers make informed choices when they eat out, especially now that a third of the calories Americans consume come from foods prepared outside the home. Many studies show that calorie intake is higher when people dine out.\\n\\nUnder the FDA’s proposal, food chains with at least 20 locations — including sit-down restaurants, fast-food outlets, bakeries, coffee shops, delis and convenience stores — must disclose calorie...</td>\n",

       "      <td>People less interested in food might be at a higher risk for cocaine addiction, according to researchers at Yale School of Medicine.\\n\\nThe new study found that a set of neurons located in the part of the brain that controls hunger are associated not only with overeating, but other behaviors not linked to food, like novelty-seeking and drug addiction.\\n\\nThe findings, published in the June 24 online issue of Nature Neuroscience, suggest that an increased interest in food leads to a decreased interest in novelty and cocaine.\\n\\nYaleNews has more information from the one of the study's leaders, Tamas L. Horvath, the Jean and David W. Wallace Professor of Biomedical Research and chair of comparative medicine at Yale School of Medicine:\\n\\nHorvath and his team argue that the hypothalamus, which controls vital functions such as body temperature, hunger, thirst fatigue and sleep, is key to the development of higher brain functions. \"These hunger-promoting neurons are critically important during development to establish the set point of higher brain functions, and their impaired function may be the underlying cause for altered motivated and cognitive behaviors,\" he said.\\n\\nThe assertion flies in the face of current wisdom that overeating is similar to cocaine abuse on a neuron level.\\n\\nAs Horvath told YaleNews, \"But here, we provide a contrasting view: that the reward aspect can be very high, but subjects can still be very lean. At the same time, it indicates that a set of people who have no interest in food, might be more prone to drug addiction.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>A proposed ban on super-sized, sugary sodas in New York City would diminish consumers' caloric intake at fast-food chains, researchers said.\\n\\nIn statistical models, limiting sugar-sweetened beverage containers to 16 oz. would cut 63 calories per consumer, Brian Elbel, PhD, MPH, of New York University, and colleagues wrote in a letter to the editor published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.\\n\\nIn May, Mayor Michael Bloomberg had proposed a ban on sales of sugary drinks bigger than 16 oz. at restaurants, movie theaters, and stadiums in an attempt to help curb the city's burgeoning obesity rates. Drinks with fewer than 25 calories per 8-oz. serving would be exempt, as would diet sodas, certain fruit juices, dairy-based drinks, and alcoholic beverages.\\n\\nIn order to evaluate the potential effect of the policy on caloric intake at fast-food chains, Elbel and colleagues created various statistical models.\\n\\nThey combined data from two studies that collected receipts from three fast-food chains in four cities between 2008 and 2010: New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Newark, N.J.\\n\\nOf these, 1,624 receipts listed a beverage, milk shakes excluded. Overall, 62% of the drinks consumers bought would be subject to the New York City ban.\\n\\nThe researchers used data from consumer surveys and information on the chains' websites to determine the number of calories in each drink.\\n\\nThey estimated that the mean calories consumed per customer from sugar-sweetened beverages was 197 calories.\\n\\nIf all consumers in the study switched to 16-oz. drinks, their mean caloric intake would drop by 63 calories per consumer, the researchers found.\\n\\nCaloric decrease would not be statistically distinguishable from zero if only 30% of consumers switched to 16-oz. beverages, they reported.\\n\\nWhen looking at only the beverages subject to the policy, the mean intake per consumer was 230 calories.

You can read all about the folly of trying to build cities in a desert.\\n\\nJust this week, economists at the University of California, Davis, estimated that water shortages will cost the state's economy $2.7 billion this year. Many farmers are limiting the economic damage by ransacking the environment instead, draining underground aquifers.\\n\\nBut let your mind wander a bit. Think about Australia. It's drier than California even in normal years, and recently, it suffered through a truly epic drought, longer and deeper than California's.\\n\\nAustralia survived, though. It came through that drought \"with no discernible decline in the quality of life!\" says David Feldman, professor of policy, planning and design at the University of California, Irvine. \"I think there's a lesson there.\"\\n\\nFeldman and some of his colleagues have taken several trips to Australia in recent years, trying to figure out what that lesson might be. It's an increasingly popular destination, in fact, for Californians who are seeking answers to burning drought questions.\\n\\n\"Australia is seen as a model that has prevailed, and has created a kind of resiliency,\" Feldman says.\\n\\nThe Australian accomplishment that most impressed Feldman was the level of public awareness about the country's water situation, especially in cities like Melbourne.\\n\\n\"On the billboards, there were actually postings about the level of water remaining in the city's reservoirs,\" he says.\\n\\nAustralians now treasure their water in a way that most Californians still don't, Feldman says.

       "      <td>When it comes to the crop insurance sweepstakes, southwest Minnesota farmer Darwyn Bach is a winner. But he concedes that his good fortune presents a quandary, since the way the program is implemented these days creates significant losers: the soil, beginning farmers and Main Street businesses that suffer when the number of families in a rural community decline. “Because of crop insurance, there really is less risk for me in grain farming right now,” Bach told me recently. “But long term for our community, it’s definitely not good.”\\n\\nBach’s concern is shared by many across the Corn Belt. A program that started out simply as a way for farmers to ride out the droughts, floods, pest infestations and other curve balls nature tosses their way has quietly transformed into one of the biggest drivers of how crop farming is carried out in this country. And as discussion over the next Farm Bill heats up—the Senate Ag Committee is hinting we may have a new bill yet this spring—it’s become clear that commodity groups, agribusiness firms and insurance companies want it to become an even bigger player in American agriculture.\\n\\nIn coming months, expect to hear a lot more about the need for taxpayers to support crop insurance. But as the feel-good “safety net” rhetoric becomes louder, beware: this program is a far cry from what its creators had in mind. Farming is inherently risky, given the vagaries of weather and markets, and that’s part of the reason programs like crop insurance were created. But there’s a difference between cushioning the blow and fueling endeavors that have widespread negative consequences,\\n\\nA major shift\\n\\nThe crop insurance program is administered by the USDA’s Risk Management Agency as a kind of a quasi-private program, with insurance policies sold and serviced through 15 to 16 approved insurance companies.\\n\\nFor decades after it was launched in 1938 by Congress, the crop insurance program focused almost exclusively on keeping farmers from being financially devastated by weather-related disas...</td>\n",

Within just a day or two, strenuous objections from the cattle industry and from Iowa Congressman Steve King led to a hasty retraction by the agency:\\n\\n“U.S.D.A. does not endorse Meatless Monday,” a spokeswoman said in a statement. The newsletter, which covered topics like the installation of energy-efficient lights on the Ag Promenade and recycling goals, “was posted without proper clearance,” the statement said.\\n\\nThat incident illustrates why I’m not terribly optimistic, to say the least, about the success of a petition recently initiated by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) seeking to remove all milk (not just the always-controversial flavored milk) from the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).\\n\\nPCRM’s concerns about the allegedly adverse effects of milk consumption are laid out in full here. With respect to serving milk in the NSLP, here’s what PCRM says in its blog:\\n\\nThe federal government spends more money on dairy products than any other food item in the school lunch program. But it’s time to get milk out of school lunches. Abundant research shows milk does not improve bone health and is the biggest source of saturated (“bad”) fat in the diet—the very fat that Dietary Guidelines push us to avoid. So PCRM recently petitioned the USDA to stop requiring milk in school lunches. The nutritional rationale for including milk in school meal programs was based primarily on its calcium content. Milk was presumed to promote bone health and integrity. Time and again, this has proven false.

       "      <td>Contrary to conventional wisdom, detailed energy measurements show that while hunter-gatherers may be more physically active than the rest of us, they don't burn more calories thanks to their lower metabolisms\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nWe all know why Americans are so fat, right? We too much junk and we sit on our duffs all day.\\n\\nPerhaps not, a team of international researchers now says. Their new study, examining energy expenditure among one of the world’s last remaining hunter-gatherer populations, seems to debunk our conventional wisdom — at least in part.\\n\\nWhile we’ve always assumed that humans’ ancient ancestors must have been more active than today’s modern Westerners — with our office jobs, our cars and our TV sets to keep us sedentary — new measurements of actual energy expenditure are surprising. They show that people in traditional foraging societies do indeed participate in more physical activity, but that their total energy output is almost identical to that of today’s pudgy Westerners. This counterintuitive finding is explained by the foragers’ lower basal metabolic rate: they expend less energy while at rest, even when we compare people of the same size and age.\\n\\n(MORE: The Secrets to Weight Loss: Keep a Food Journal, Don’t Skip Meals, Eat In)\\n\\nTo gather the startling new measurements, researchers recruited 30 adults from the Hadza hunter-gatherer society, a small population living in the East African country of Tanzania. No society today is truly like the those of our ancestors tens of thousands of years ago, the researchers say, but the Hadza do share some important similarities with our Pleistocene-era forbears.\\n\\nIn particular, the Hadza maintain a traditional foraging lifestyle, hunting on foot using bows, small axes and digging sticks, and without modern tools like vehicles or guns. Their diet includes virtually no processed foods whatsoever. They live off of game that they hunt, and tubers, fruit and honey that they collect.\\n\\nTo measure energy use, participating Hadza adults wore GPS ...</td>\n",

From the Union of Concerned Scientists: UCS announces a new position paper, “Lessons from the Lunchroom: Childhood Obesity, School Lunch, and the Way to a Healthier Future,” also documenting why school meals are so important to kids’ health.

       "1  Domino's Pizza manager T.J. Djigue creates a hand tossed pizza in Bethesda, MD. The FDA is crafting regulations that would require major chain restaurants to label calorie counts on their menus. (Katherine Frey/THE WASHINGTON POST)\\n\\nA Big Mac is a Big Mac.\\n\\nBut a pizza? There are 34 million ways to customize it, depending on toppings and crust and size, according to the number-crunchers at Domino’s.\\n\\nThat’s the message that some of the nation’s largest pizza chains want to impress upon Capitol Hill lawmakers Wednesday as they push for changes to a proposed menu labeling plan that would force chain restaurants and other food outlets to post the calorie counts of the foods they’re selling.\\n\\nA fledgling coalition of pizza chains — including Domino’s, Papa John’s, Little Caesars, Godfather’s Pizza and Pizza Hut — argues that the government’s plan forces store owners to pay for in-store menu boards that most of their customers don’t see before ordering. The American Pizza Community, as the coalition is called, says 90 percent of their orders are placed online and over the phone.\\n\\nThen there’s the problem of squeezing all the potential offerings onto one menu board.\\n\\n“A light bulb goes on when people hear about all the possible combinations for pizza,” said Lynn Liddle, a Domino’s executive and chair of the coalition. “They start to realize how difficult it would be to take a one-size-fits-all approach.”\\n\\nCongress required menu labeling as part of the health-care reform law enacted in 2010, and the FDA has been working on the details ever since. The goal is to combat obesity by helping consumers make informed choices when they eat out, especially now that a third of the calories Americans consume come from foods prepared outside the home. Many studies show that calorie intake is higher when people dine out.\\n\\nUnder the FDA’s proposal, food chains with at least 20 locations — including sit-down restaurants, fast-food outlets, bakeries, coffee shops, delis and convenience stores — must disclose calorie...   \n",

Horvath, the Jean and David W. Wallace Professor of Biomedical Research and chair of comparative medicine at Yale School of Medicine:\\n\\nHorvath and his team argue that the hypothalamus, which controls vital functions such as body temperature, hunger, thirst fatigue and sleep, is key to the development of higher brain functions. \"These hunger-promoting neurons are critically important during development to establish the set point of higher brain functions, and their impaired function may be the underlying cause for altered motivated and cognitive behaviors,\" he said.\\n\\nThe assertion flies in the face of current wisdom that overeating is similar to cocaine abuse on a neuron level.\\n\\nAs Horvath told YaleNews, \"But here, we provide a contrasting view: that the reward aspect can be very high, but subjects can still be very lean. At the same time, it indicates that a set of people who have no interest in food, might be more prone to drug addiction.\"   \n",
       "3  Obesity is a global epidemic. The World Health Organization now places it as the world's leading non-communicable disease, ahead of even diabetes or cancer. And Americans are more obese than most.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, people believe that either genetics--if your mom or dad was obese, then you're likely to be as well--or personal choices are to blame. Most obesity researchers--and most diets--focus nearly exclusively on the individual and the daily food choices each of us makes.\\n\\nNew, fad diets or efforts to limit what we eat and drink make news constantly. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to limit the serving sizes of sugary sodas to combat obesity, for instance, drew constant ridicule from Jon Stewart at the Daily Show.\\n\\nBut what if it's considerably more complicated than that--and what if we're missing the collective forest for the trees?\\n\\n[Unlimited Data Sharing, Storage a Flash of Light Away]\\n\\nDavid Kessler, in his New York Times best-selling book The End of Over-Eating, proved that nearly every large, multinational food processing company has known for years that marketing was successfully driving food consumers toward processed food that was almost certain to make them more obese.\\n\\nNow, a new study in the journal Scientific Reports by researchers at the City College of New York has shown something rather remarkable: The environment in which we live may be even more important than either genetics or our individual food choices in determining the prevalence ofobesity.\\n\\nBasically, the CCNY researchers found direct correlations between the obesity epidemic's geography in the United States and food marketing and distribution patterns.\\n\\nUsing county-level data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for the years 2004 to 2008, here's what they found: In certain parts of the United States, where there was greater opportunity and access to plentiful food and where marketing introduced them to a food economy--a high density of restaurants, bars, package stores, supermarkets--th...   \n",
       "4  A proposed ban on super-sized, sugary sodas in New York City would diminish consumers' caloric intake at fast-food chains, researchers said.\\n\\nIn statistical models, limiting sugar-sweetened beverage containers to 16 oz. would cut 63 calories per consumer, Brian Elbel, PhD, MPH, of New York University, and colleagues wrote in a letter to the editor published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.\\n\\nIn May, Mayor Michael Bloomberg had proposed a ban on sales of sugary drinks bigger than 16 oz. at restaurants, movie theaters, and stadiums in an attempt to help curb the city's burgeoning obesity rates. Drinks with fewer than 25 calories per 8-oz. serving would be exempt, as would diet sodas, certain fruit juices, dairy-based drinks, and alcoholic beverages.\\n\\nIn order to evaluate the potential effect of the policy on caloric intake at fast-food chains, Elbel and colleagues created various statistical models.\\n\\nThey combined data from two studies that collected receipts from three fast-food chains in four cities between 2008 and 2010: New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Newark, N.J.\\n\\nOf these, 1,624 receipts listed a beverage, milk shakes excluded. Overall, 62% of the drinks consumers bought would be subject to the New York City ban.\\n\\nThe researchers used data from consumer surveys and information on the chains' websites to determine the number of calories in each drink.\\n\\nThey estimated that the mean calories consumed per customer from sugar-sweetened beverages was 197 calories.\\n\\nIf all consumers in the study switched to 16-oz. drinks, their mean caloric intake would drop by 63 calories per consumer, the researchers found.\\n\\nCaloric decrease would not be statistically distinguishable from zero if only 30% of consumers switched to 16-oz. beverages, they reported.\\n\\nWhen looking at only the beverages subject to the policy, the mean intake per consumer was 230 calories. If all of these patrons made the switch to 16-oz. drinks, they'd trim 74 calories per consumer from their meals, Elbel and ...   \n",
       "5  Producers\\n\\nIn Search Of A Drought Strategy, California Looks Down Under\\n\\ni itoggle caption Martin Benik/Corbis Martin Benik/Corbis\\n\\nJudging by some of the most pessimistic reports from California these days, the place is doomed. You can read all about the folly of trying to build cities in a desert.\\n\\nJust this week, economists at the University of California, Davis, estimated that water shortages will cost the state's economy $2.7 billion this year. Many farmers are limiting the economic damage by ransacking the environment instead, draining underground aquifers.\\n\\nBut let your mind wander a bit. Think about Australia. It's drier than California even in normal years, and recently, it suffered through a truly epic drought, longer and deeper than California's.\\n\\nAustralia survived, though. It came through that drought \"with no discernible decline in the quality of life!\" says David Feldman, professor of policy, planning and design at the University of California, Irvine. \"I think there's a lesson there.\"\\n\\nFeldman and some of his colleagues have taken several trips to Australia in recent years, trying to figure out what that lesson might be. It's an increasingly popular destination, in fact, for Californians who are seeking answers to burning drought questions.\\n\\n\"Australia is seen as a model that has prevailed, and has created a kind of resiliency,\" Feldman says.\\n\\nThe Australian accomplishment that most impressed Feldman was the level of public awareness about the country's water situation, especially in cities like Melbourne.\\n\\n\"On the billboards, there were actually postings about the level of water remaining in the city's reservoirs,\" he says.\\n\\nAustralians now treasure their water in a way that most Californians still don't, Feldman says. In Melbourne, in recent years, the average person has been using just half as much water as the average person in LA. You don't see nearly as many of those green, grassy lawns.\\n\\nA bigger challenge lies outside the cities. The biggest use of water by far,...   \n",
       "6  When it comes to the crop insurance sweepstakes, southwest Minnesota farmer Darwyn Bach is a winner. But he concedes that his good fortune presents a quandary, since the way the program is implemented these days creates significant losers: the soil, beginning farmers and Main Street businesses that suffer when the number of families in a rural community decline. “Because of crop insurance, there really is less risk for me in grain farming right now,” Bach told me recently. “But long term for our community, it’s definitely not good.”\\n\\nBach’s concern is shared by many across the Corn Belt. A program that started out simply as a way for farmers to ride out the droughts, floods, pest infestations and other curve balls nature tosses their way has quietly transformed into one of the biggest drivers of how crop farming is carried out in this country. And as discussion over the next Farm Bill heats up—the Senate Ag Committee is hinting we may have a new bill yet this spring—it’s become clear that commodity groups, agribusiness firms and insurance companies want it to become an even bigger player in American agriculture.\\n\\nIn coming months, expect to hear a lot more about the need for taxpayers to support crop insurance. But as the feel-good “safety net” rhetoric becomes louder, beware: this program is a far cry from what its creators had in mind. Farming is inherently risky, given the vagaries of weather and markets, and that’s part of the reason programs like crop insurance were created. But there’s a difference between cushioning the blow and fueling endeavors that have widespread negative consequences,\\n\\nA major shift\\n\\nThe crop insurance program is administered by the USDA’s Risk Management Agency as a kind of a quasi-private program, with insurance policies sold and serviced through 15 to 16 approved insurance companies.\\n\\nFor decades after it was launched in 1938 by Congress, the crop insurance program focused almost exclusively on keeping farmers from being financially devastated by weather-related disas...   \n",
       "7  The U.S. Department of Agriculture got into a little trouble this week when an interoffice newsletter encouraged USDA employees to participate in the growing nationwide practice of observing “Meatless Mondays,” i.e, abstaining from meat one day a week to promote personal health and the health of the planet. Within just a day or two, strenuous objections from the cattle industry and from Iowa Congressman Steve King led to a hasty retraction by the agency:\\n\\n“U.S.D.A. does not endorse Meatless Monday,” a spokeswoman said in a statement. The newsletter, which covered topics like the installation of energy-efficient lights on the Ag Promenade and recycling goals, “was posted without proper clearance,” the statement said.\\n\\nThat incident illustrates why I’m not terribly optimistic, to say the least, about the success of a petition recently initiated by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) seeking to remove all milk (not just the always-controversial flavored milk) from the National School Lunch Program (NSLP).\\n\\nPCRM’s concerns about the allegedly adverse effects of milk consumption are laid out in full here. With respect to serving milk in the NSLP, here’s what PCRM says in its blog:\\n\\nThe federal government spends more money on dairy products than any other food item in the school lunch program. But it’s time to get milk out of school lunches. Abundant research shows milk does not improve bone health and is the biggest source of saturated (“bad”) fat in the diet—the very fat that Dietary Guidelines push us to avoid. So PCRM recently petitioned the USDA to stop requiring milk in school lunches. The nutritional rationale for including milk in school meal programs was based primarily on its calcium content. Milk was presumed to promote bone health and integrity. Time and again, this has proven false. Milk-drinking children do not have stronger bones than children who get their calcium from other foods.\\n\\nBut whatever you think of the merits of the science (and I’m not weighing in here), the...   \n",
       "8  Contrary to conventional wisdom, detailed energy measurements show that while hunter-gatherers may be more physically active than the rest of us, they don't burn more calories thanks to their lower metabolisms\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nWe all know why Americans are so fat, right? We too much junk and we sit on our duffs all day.\\n\\nPerhaps not, a team of international researchers now says. Their new study, examining energy expenditure among one of the world’s last remaining hunter-gatherer populations, seems to debunk our conventional wisdom — at least in part.\\n\\nWhile we’ve always assumed that humans’ ancient ancestors must have been more active than today’s modern Westerners — with our office jobs, our cars and our TV sets to keep us sedentary — new measurements of actual energy expenditure are surprising. They show that people in traditional foraging societies do indeed participate in more physical activity, but that their total energy output is almost identical to that of today’s pudgy Westerners. This counterintuitive finding is explained by the foragers’ lower basal metabolic rate: they expend less energy while at rest, even when we compare people of the same size and age.\\n\\n(MORE: The Secrets to Weight Loss: Keep a Food Journal, Don’t Skip Meals, Eat In)\\n\\nTo gather the startling new measurements, researchers recruited 30 adults from the Hadza hunter-gatherer society, a small population living in the East African country of Tanzania. No society today is truly like the those of our ancestors tens of thousands of years ago, the researchers say, but the Hadza do share some important similarities with our Pleistocene-era forbears.\\n\\nIn particular, the Hadza maintain a traditional foraging lifestyle, hunting on foot using bows, small axes and digging sticks, and without modern tools like vehicles or guns. Their diet includes virtually no processed foods whatsoever. They live off of game that they hunt, and tubers, fruit and honey that they collect.\\n\\nTo measure energy use, participating Hadza adults wore GPS ...   \n",
       "9  Twenty-five years ago minister Edwina Currie sparked a scare over salmonella in eggs and had to resign amid outrage from farmers and plummeting sales. The panic has shaped the way we think about food safety.\\n\\nThere are foods that people instinctively associate with the risk of poisoning - raw chicken, raw egg, shellfish.\\n\\nAt the time of Edwina Currie's remarks - which were perceived to have dramatically exaggerated the prevalence of the disease in eggs in the UK - there were 12,302 cases of the salmonella PT4 strand most commonly found in poultry.\\n\\nIt dropped by 54% in the three years following the introduction of the British Lion scheme in 1998, which saw hens vaccinated against salmonella, and last year there were just 229 reported cases.\\n\\nBut people are still mistrustful.\\n\\nHow to avoid food poisoning Wash your hands, wash your worktops and wash your dishcloths and tea towels - and let them dry\\n\\nTake care with raw meat - chop it on a separate board, keep it away from ready-to-eat food and store on bottom of fridge (to avoid dripping)\\n\\nEnsure your fridge is below 5ºC; cool leftovers quickly after heating (within 90 minutes) and eat within two days\\n\\nRespect use-by dates Source: NHS Choices\\n\\nPregnant women, the elderly and young children are warned against eating a runny yolk, and forums on parenting websites contain discussion threads on the perils of raw cake mix.\\n\\n\"The saying was that salmonella and eggs go together like a horse and carriage,\" says Sarah O'Brien, professor of Infection Epidemiology and Zoonoses at the University of Liverpool. \"But that's not the case.
